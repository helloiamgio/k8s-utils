there would not be any "leftover" rules after flushing every table. In the interest of being thorough however, you may want to set the policy for the built-in INPUT and FORWARD chains to ACCEPT, as well:

iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -F
iptables -X

iptables -vnxL

iptables-save | tee iptables_backup.conf ### | grep -v '\-A' | iptables-restore
iptables-restore < iptables_backup.conf
